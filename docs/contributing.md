# Contributing to Intermark

Hey there! If you've stumbled upon this project and are interested in contributing, that's awesome! Since this is a small project, we can keep things pretty relaxed. Here's how you can get involved:

## Quick and Easy Ways to Contribute

- **Spot a bug?** Open an issue. Try to be as specific as possible.
- **Have a fix or want to add something?** Submit a pull request. If it's something big, maybe open an issue first to discuss it.
- **Improvement suggestions?** Those are always welcome. Just open up an issue and let's chat about it.

## Pull Requests

When you submit your pull request, it's greatly appreciated! This project isn't aiming for rapid growth or a large team, but if you find it useful and want to contribute, that's pretty cool. Your involvement, whether through using the package or improving it, is a wonderful vote of confidence. I'll review and handle pull requests as time allows, and I'm grateful for your interest and contributions!

When you submit your pull request:

- Keep your changes concise and focused on a single issue.
- Write clear, understandable code (comment anything that might be tricky).
- Stick to the basic Go formatting rules.
- Test your changes before submitting.

## Questions or Problems?

Just open an issue. I'm still learning a lot of this stuff, so let's figure it out together. Remember, the sun is going to explode and the universe will die from heat death. Don't stress too much about getting everything perfect <3
